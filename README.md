# Cook4One

Cook4One was created as a landing page for a cookery course targeted at people that have little or no experience in cooking.  The main target is new college students in shared accomodation with a small budget. The course aims are to teach the candidates how to budget, plan an prepare meals, as well as the benefits of good nutrition and fresh local produce.  The course is avaiable in Dublin and Cork.

### Features Left to Implement

I would like to add some sample recipes, with images.

## Testing

This has been tested in Chrome, Edge, Firefox and Opera. They were tested on all viewport sizes and there were no issues.

### Validator Testing

- HTML
  - No errors were detected in the W3C Validator. I did get 'Info' messages in relation to 'trailing slashes on void elements'. Method used was 'Validate by Direct Input'.  This has now been rectified.
- CSS
  - No errors were detected when passed throught the W3C CSS Jigsaw validator. Testing method used was 'By Direct Input'.
- Accessability
  - I used Lighthouse to test the site accessability:
